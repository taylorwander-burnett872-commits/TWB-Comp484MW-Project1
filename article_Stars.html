                <h1>S.T.A.R.S Members Suspended Following Arklay Mountains Investigation</h1><br>
                <p>The destruction of Umbrella's Arklay Mountains Executive Vacation Club was an unfortunate tragedy felt all across the company. Out of the disaster, a series of bad-actors from the Raccoon City Police Department subdivision of S.T.A.R.S took the opportunity to propagate some nasty rumors in regards to the facilities destruction. Now, following an investigation into those claims, the RPD has announced the well-deserved suspension of said agents. Let us take the opportunity to refute their claims once again and provide some clarity on why we think those S.T.A.R.S agents began to attack Umbrella in the first place.</p><br>
